# WebProgramming_finalproject
Webpage final report Our group made a text adventure RPG, except for battle.js, I wrote all the programs. You need to download the xampp software, put all the loaded files in htdocs, and then open xampp_controll to start the above two items and then use it as admin, and import game_accout into the mySQL database, then connect xampp to sign_in.php to play the game. MySQL needs to create a permission with account "geinwismsh" and password "0000" for the game_accout data table.
